# pet-names

Through this project, we aim to analyze trends about pet names in Seattle and New York City from the last 5 years. We will organize and adjust the
Seattle and New York City databases accordingly, in order to compare and analyze them properly. We are finding how many distinct names there are total, which
will allow us insight the values of pet owners. We will investigate the most popular names in each city individually, as well as overall to understand
overarching trends and patterns across big cities. This will benefit average day citizens who are interested in the topics of city life, urban planners,
and for the future generations and historians who will get a lens into an aspect of the world as we know it today.

We also consider which breeds of pets are the most popular in these two cities for additional analysis and perspective.

TAKEAWAY FIGURE:
Our charts tell us that the Top 5 Pet Names overall (Seattle and NYC), are:
1. Luna
2. Bella
3. Charlie
4. Max
5. Lucy

Our report caters to pet enthusiasts, aspiring pet owners, animal welfare advocates, businesses, city planners, and researchers interested in the intersection
of community, pets, and urban dynamics.
